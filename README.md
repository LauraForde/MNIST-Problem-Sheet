# MNIST Problem Sheet

> Emerging Technologies 4th Year [module](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/)  
> Taught by Dr Ian McLoughlin  
> Solve three [problems](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/digits.html) based on the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set using Python

**Exercise 1 - Read Data Files**  
After downloading both the image and labels file, this script will decompress both the image and label files, reading them byte by byte into appropriate data structures.

**Exercise 2 - Output an Image to the Console**  
This exercise requires me to output an image to the console. I will achieve this by representing pixels with values less that 128 as full stops and other pixels are a hash.

**Exercise 3 - Output the Image Files as PNG Files**  
For this exercise all images will be saved in a subfolder in this repository.

**Note**  
If you would like to try run these exercises on your own machine you will need to visit the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data page and download the image and label files and put them in a folder named 'data'. This is required as I have put the data folder in the git ignore file. The rough.py file is work we done in class with the help of oour lecturer.
